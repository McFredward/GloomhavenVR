# Bundle content: Hands/

Intended assets (Phase 2 `feat/hands` consumes these from `gloomhavenvr.bundle`):

| Asset | Description |
|---|---|
| `Valve/vr_glove_left_model_slim.fbx` | Left hand, skinned, SteamVR skeleton — imported from the SteamVR Unity Plugin (BSD-3-Clause), see `unity/HANDS.md` |
| `Valve/vr_glove_right_model_slim.fbx` | Right hand, same source |
| `Valve/Materials/vr_glove_color.mat` + `vr_glove_color.jpg` + `vr_glove_normal.png` | Glove material/textures. The material uses the built-in Standard shader — the mod rebinds it at runtime against the game's shader set (built-in shaders are never bundled, TOOLCHAIN.md §4.1) |
| `Valve/LICENSE-Valve.txt` | Valve's BSD-3-Clause license text — REQUIRED attribution, keep next to the assets and in release zips |
| `HandLeft.prefab` / `HandRight.prefab` | Our own prefabs: glove mesh + named bone hierarchy for the FingerCurler (2 bones per finger driven directly — no Animator). Do NOT import Valve's `*RenderModel*.prefab`s; they reference SteamVR MonoBehaviours we do not ship |

Conventions:
- Prefab root at wrist, +Z pointing along fingers, +Y out of the back of the hand
  (matches the OpenXR `pointerPosition/pointerRotation` grip convention closely
  enough; final offsets live in mod code, not in the asset).
- Keep polycount as-is (the "slim" gloves are already low-poly).
- Everything in this folder except `*.md` / `*.txt` / dotfiles is packed into
  `gloomhavenvr.bundle` by `Assets/Editor/BuildBundles.cs`.
