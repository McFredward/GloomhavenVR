/// <summary>
/// DECISION DOCK (test #22, generalizes the test-#21 take-damage dock): every
/// in-scenario decision/confirmation the game shows as a flat modal window — the
/// take-damage burn choice (<c>TakeDamagePanel</c>), the burn-confirm dialog
/// (<c>UIManager.dialogPopup</c>: "burn this card / choose another"), and any prompt
/// added later to the <see cref="ModalFallback.DecisionDock"/> registry — is invisible
/// in VR and would deadlock the game waiting for a click. Pre-#22 the generic
/// <see cref="ModalFallback"/> floated the WHOLE 1920×1080 window in front of the HMD
/// and asserted ModalUI, which disabled the card fan's palm gate — even though these
/// prompts have follow-ups that NEED the fan (the burn choice continues in a LoseCard
/// fan pick; test #21 log: <c>fan state: mode=LoseCard … gateEnabled=False
/// (vrMode=ModalUI)</c>). Test #21 solved that for TakeDamagePanel but docked the row
/// CENTERED OVER the two parked cards (the test-#22 complaint that the buttons "fly
/// over the cards").
///
/// This single surface docks ONLY the interactive widget row of whichever prompt is
/// open — the REAL game buttons/toggles, so labels/localization and the native
/// interactable/dim states ride along — onto <see cref="PlayTray.DecisionMount"/>, the
/// reserved zone BELOW the two cards (see the collision math in PlayTray.BuildMounts).
/// The row is found STRUCTURALLY (never by name) per prompt — the deepest common
/// ancestor of the actionable widgets that is a strict descendant of the window root
/// (see <see cref="ModalFallback.DecisionDock.IsolateRow"/>) — so it survives hierarchy
/// renames and drags nothing but the buttons. Poke AND laser click it through the
/// standard conversion registration (Convert's pokeable default → UguiPokeSurfaces +
/// RayUguiDriver), exactly like the floated modal the clicks already worked on.
///
/// The REST of the window — vignette, backdrop, the flat window frame AND the embedded
/// card (whose real rendering + burn VFX is a PARALLEL worker's job, not this one's) —
/// is VISUALLY suppressed the way the 2D hand is
/// (<see cref="Cards.Patches.HandSuppression"/>): the window root's CanvasGroup is
/// forced alpha 0 / blocksRaycasts false every tick (the game rewrites alpha on
/// Show/ToggleVisibility), and nested <see cref="Canvas"/> components under the root
/// (which render INDEPENDENTLY of the root CanvasGroup alpha) are component-disabled,
/// stopping their whole subtree rendering (the CanvasConversion nested-canvas lesson,
/// tests #19/#20). Nothing is destroyed; everything is restored on undock.
///
/// MODE MACHINE (task 3): no ModalUI is asserted for a docked decision —
/// <see cref="ModalFallback"/> stands its generic path down for any window
/// <see cref="ModalFallback.DecisionDock.ClaimsWindow"/> claims (both the ID-tracked
/// TakeDamagePanel AND the poll-tracked dialogPopup), so the flow mode
/// (HalfSelection/LoseCard/ChooseCards) and the fan's palm gate stay live through the
/// whole prompt, and the game itself never locks the UI here. The burn-confirm dialog
/// FOLLOWS a LoseCard pick, so the fan MUST stay live.
///
/// TIMING (task 4): docking is LEVEL-TRIGGERED on the game's own window open state
/// (<see cref="ModalFallback.DecisionDock.ActivePrompt"/> → the prompt's IsOpen), never
/// on a hover preview — nothing about hovering a choice pre-transforms the board, and
/// the row now lives BELOW the cards, so there is no over-slot overlay to mistake for a
/// hover change. The dock appears only while a prompt is ACTUALLY OPEN and vanishes the
/// moment it closes.
///
/// LIFECYCLE (task 5): any close path (any choice, game-side close, scene death)
/// releases the conversion — which restores the row to its exact 2D home
/// (CanvasConversion restore records) and lifts the suppression — and dock/undock are
/// logged once per flip. Decisions are sequential (the burn-confirm opens only after
/// the take-damage panel handed off), so this surface docks ONE prompt at a time.
///
/// SAFETY NET (task 5): while a claim holds the generic fallback stands down — but if
/// the row cannot be isolated (widgets missing/not yet pooled, common ancestor
/// degenerates to the window root, Convert failure) the claim is RELEASED after a short
/// grace (<see cref="ClaimGraceSeconds"/>) via
/// <see cref="ModalFallback.DecisionDock.MarkGaveUp"/> and ModalFallback floats the
/// whole window generically next tick (window + ModalUI): a worse experience, never a
/// deadlock. The manual A/X screen chord stays the universal rescue (it releases the
/// conversion so the full window shows on the 2D composite).
