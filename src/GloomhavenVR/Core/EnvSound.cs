/// <para><b>USER CORRECTION, same day, verbatim</b> — it reverses the earlier ruling that the horror
/// easter eggs are silent: "Ich nehme die Entscheidung von zuvor zurück, die Grusel-Erscheinungen
/// sollen NICHT stumm bleiben. Auch hier sollen Soundeffekte kommen aber auch nicht aufdringlich und
/// nur wenn die Umgebungssounds aktiviert sind." So the apparitions DO make sound, on this file's
/// one toggle and no second switch of their own. <c>Haunt.cs:74-75</c> still carries the old "ohne
/// sound" quotation as the reason it publishes no audio channel — that remains true of THAT file
/// (it is still the switch and nothing else); the sound is made here, from the schedule
/// <see cref="Haunt.Resolve"/> now exposes.</para>
///
/// <para><b>WHY THIS IS RUNTIME CODE AND NOT BUNDLE CONTENT.</b> The environment asset bundle ships
/// no MonoBehaviours at all (<c>unity/.../Editor/BuildEnvironments.cs:35</c>) and no audio. An
/// <see cref="AudioSource"/> is a COMPONENT, so spatial sound cannot come from the bundle even in
/// principle — it has to be created at runtime. (An <see cref="AudioClip"/> is data and could have
/// shipped; <see cref="EnvSoundBank"/> explains why it is synthesized instead.)</para>
///
/// =============================================================================================
/// <para><b>THE LISTENER, AND THE FINDING THAT HAD TO BE FIXED BEFORE ANY OF THIS COULD WORK.</b></para>
///
/// <para>Spatial audio is meaningless without an <see cref="AudioListener"/> on the head, and this
/// mod did not have one. The listener is SCENE-AUTHORED — nothing in the decompiled game ever calls
/// <c>AddComponent&lt;AudioListener&gt;</c>; <c>AudioController.GetCurrentAudioListener()</c>
/// (GH.Runtime/AudioController.cs:940-951) resolves it once with <c>FindObjectOfType</c> and caches
/// it. The mod's own head camera (<c>Rig/VRRigDriver.HeadCamera.cs:288-367</c>) adds exactly a
/// <c>Camera</c> and a <c>TrackedPoseDriver</c> and no listener. Meanwhile the game camera that
/// carries the authored listener is deliberately kept ALIVE and ENABLED
/// (<c>WorldUI/FlatScreen.3.Desktop.cs:225-233</c> — disabling it would break <c>Camera.main</c>)
/// but PARKED: its transform writers are prefix-skipped
/// (<c>Rig/CameraControllerPatches.cs:30-34, 48-52</c>). So the ear has been sitting at a frozen
/// orbit pose, many world units from the head, at a world scale that is not 1.</para>
///
/// <para>That is not a new bug this feature introduces — it is the documented cause of the card-fan
/// sound bug (<c>Core/GameAudio.cs:16-22</c>: a 3D item played at a transform "attenuates to
/// nothing — SILENTLY"). What is new is that this feature CANNOT work around it: an ambience whose
/// sources are in the room is exactly a set of 3D items.</para>
///
/// <para><b>THE FIX: this file takes ownership of the listener while it is running.</b> It adds an
/// <see cref="AudioListener"/> to the mod's head camera and disables every other enabled one,
/// remembering each so <see cref="StandDown"/> can put them back exactly. Unity permits only one
/// enabled listener; more than one is undefined behaviour and logs a warning per frame.</para>
///
/// <para><b>WHY THIS IS SAFE FOR THE GAME'S OWN AUDIO, which is the obvious objection.</b> The
/// cached reference inside <c>AudioController</c> keeps pointing at the authored (now disabled)
/// component, and it re-resolves only if that reference goes NULL (:943-950) — disabling a component
/// does not null it, so the controller never notices. Every game sound the mod actually triggers
/// goes through <c>AudioController.Play(item)</c>, the LISTENER-ANCHORED overload
/// (<c>Core/GameAudio.cs:83</c>), which ignores position; and the game's own UI items are 2D
/// (<c>AudioItem.spatialBlend</c> defaults to 0, ClockStone/AudioItem.cs:67), so position is
/// ignored there too. The only class of sound whose behaviour could change is a 3D game item played
/// positionally — and those are ALREADY inaudible today for precisely the reason quoted above. The
/// change can therefore make that class better or leave it as it is; it cannot make it worse.</para>
///
/// <para><b>REJECTED: moving the authored listener's transform to the head.</b> A component cannot
/// be moved between GameObjects, so this would mean moving the game CAMERA — which is the flat
/// screen's own render source (<c>WorldUI/FlatScreen.2.CameraStack.cs:47-64</c>). The desktop mirror
/// would follow the player's head around the room.</para>
///
/// <para><b>REJECTED: registering our clips with the game's controller</b> via
/// <c>AudioController.AddToCategory(category, clip, id)</c> (AudioController.cs:1142). It is a real
/// API and it would inherit the player's category volumes for free. It also hands playback to a
/// POOL of the controller's own prefabs — no per-source rolloff we can scale, no persistent looping
/// voice we own, and a <c>MinTimeBetweenPlayCalls</c> throttle that silently drops plays
/// (:1611). We need long-lived, individually-tuned, scale-corrected sources. The player's volume

///
/// =============================================================================================
/// <para><b>THE SCALE PROBLEM, AND WHY A TYPED ROLLOFF WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG BY A FACTOR OF ~20.</b></para>
///
/// <para>Unity's distance attenuation is in WORLD UNITS. The environment is not placed at world
/// scale: the rig root's <c>lossyScale</c> IS the diorama scale (<c>Rig/VRRigDriver.cs:61-65</c>,
/// written as <c>rig.localScale = Vector3.one * s</c> in <c>Rig/Comfort.cs:74</c>), and
/// <see cref="SkyAlternative"/> reads it as <c>anchor.lossyScale.x</c> (SkyAlternative.cs:1282) and
/// converts world to perceived by DIVIDING by it (":1373", <c>perceived = extent / rigScale</c>).
/// So:</para>
/// <code>
///     rigScale = world units per PERCEIVED METRE          (the log reports values like 21…26)
///     worldDistance = perceivedMetres * rigScale
/// </code>
/// <para>An attenuation curve authored in metres and typed straight into
/// <see cref="AudioSource.minDistance"/> would therefore reach full attenuation about twenty times
/// too close — every environment sound would be inaudible except when the player's head was
/// practically inside it. The fix is one multiply, applied to BOTH distances of every source, and
/// re-applied whenever the scale changes: <see cref="Tick"/> takes the live <c>rigScale</c> from the
/// caller and re-scales the sources when it moves by more than
/// <see cref="ScaleRefreshTolerance"/>. Zoom is exactly such a change
/// (<c>SkyAlternative.NotifyRigScaled</c> is the existing hook and both its callers are zoom
/// gestures), which is why this cannot be a one-time setup.</para>
///
/// <para><b>AND THE DOPPLER IS ZERO, for the same reason.</b> Every source here is static in world
/// space, but the LISTENER is not: at rigScale ~22 a comfortable head movement is ~22 world units
/// per second, which Unity would hear as a supersonic listener and pitch-shift accordingly.
/// <see cref="AudioSource.dopplerLevel"/> 0 is not a stylistic choice, it is the only correct value
