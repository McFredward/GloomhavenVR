//  Active / persistent cards — PER-ACTOR MODEL
// =================================================================================================

/// <summary>
/// A peer's ACTIVE (round-long / persistent) ability cards, drawn as a small column off the far
/// RIGHT edge — the mirror of the local board's <c>ActivePileViewer</c> and at the same base offset
/// (<c>PlayTray.ActiveMountBase</c> = board half-width + 0.012 + <c>ActiveMountOffsetX</c>), just past
/// the pile stacks.
///
/// SOURCE (per-actor model, zero wire): <c>CCharacterClass.ActivatedAbilityCards</c> — the very list
/// the local <c>ActivePileViewer</c> is fed from, read off the host-replicated actor. Card FRONTS
/// (name) are shown only through <see cref="RevealGate.ShowRoundCardFronts"/>, so during the secret
/// selection phase a peer's active column shows BACKS — the same stance the round-card slots take.
/// In practice an active card is public by definition (it was played face-up in front of everybody),
/// so the gate can only ever be stricter than vanilla, never looser.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>CLASSIFICATION: PER-ACTOR MODEL — ZERO wire. Source:
/// <c>CCharacterClass.ActivatedAbilityCards</c> off the host-replicated actor
/// (<c>NetPlayerActors.ActorFor</c>), fronts gated by <see cref="RevealGate"/>. Card IDENTITY is
/// DELIBERATELY-NOT on the wire, ever — it is resolved locally through the gate instead. See
/// INVARIANTS-Net-Rig.md "Net — content classification".</remarks>
